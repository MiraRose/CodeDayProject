What It Does: This page takes an organization name and returns a list of public repositories using Github's API and a count of how many respositories displayed. Clicking a respository opens a new tab with that repository on GitHub.

Important Note: It is rate-limited to 60 calls an hour.

About the Code: Tests are included.
